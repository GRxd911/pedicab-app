Chapter I
Introduction

Pedicab drivers in Dumaguete City make numerous decisions every day, such as choosing which passenger to pick up, selecting appropriate routes and deciding how long to work. Continuously making these decisions for extended periods can lead to mental exhaustion, commonly known as decision fatigue.

When pedicab drivers experience decision fatigue, they may become stressed and confused. These conditions can negatively affect their safety, health, and daily income, and may also affect commuters. Because of this, there is a need for a system that can help reduce mental exhaustion and support better decision-making among pedicab drivers.

The Pedicab Driver Decision Fatigue System is developed to assist pedicab drivers in Dumaguete City by providing simple and clear guidance. The system includes a virtual map feature that shows the availability of commuters in specific areas and the routes that the pedicab driver will pass through. This helps drivers decide where to go next without confusion or unnecessary overthinking. The system also benefits the commuters particularly students by making transportation easier and faster, especially for those living in secluded or hard-to-reach areas. By helping drivers choose better routes and stay focused, the system ensures that they can reach their destinations more quickly, safely, and conveniently while improving the overall reliability of pedicab services within the city.

Name of the Specific Establishment
The system will be implemented under the Traffic Management Office (TMO) of Dumaguete City for pedicab drivers operating within Dumaguete City. The proposed system is called the Pedicab Driver Decision Fatigue Support System. It is specifically designed for local pedicab drivers who provide daily transportation services throughout the city.
The system focuses on small-scale and community-based pedicab operations in Dumaguete City, where drivers often work long hours and rely heavily on personal judgment when making daily work-related decisions. Through the support of the TMO, the system aims to promote safer, more organized, and more efficient pedicab operations within the city.

Address of the Establishment

 	The Pedicab Driver Decision Fatigue Support System will be used within Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. The system will support pedicab drivers operating in different barangays of the city, including the secluded areas, main roads, and residential areas.
The system is designed to be accessible anywhere within Dumaguete City where pedicab drivers normally work.

Statement of the Problem

 	Pedicab drivers are selected with    passengers they refuse to take them to places that are far and secluded areas. For commuters, it takes a long time to get a ride because no pedicabs are willing to take them to their locations.
 	Other problems is that lack of vehicles in an area and commuters will be delayed of their works or special appointment it’s better to have this system for needs








Scope and Limitations

 	The Pedicab Driver Decision Fatigue Support System is designed to assist pedicab drivers in Dumaguete City by providing guidance on passenger availability, optimal routes, and work-rest schedules to reduce decision fatigue. The system is mobile-based for drivers and commuters, particularly students, and includes a web-based platform for the Traffic Management Office (TMO) to monitor operations. Its implementation focuses on small-scale, community-based pedicab services, covering main roads, residential areas, and secluded locations within the city. Limitations of the system include reliance on mobile devices and internet connectivity, potential inaccuracies in passenger requests or location data, and the fact that it is only applicable within Dumaguete City. The system’s effectiveness is also limited by user adoption and the drivers’ willingness to follow the suggested routes and recommendations.

Objectives
•	To reduce mental fatigue and decision-making stress among pedicab drivers in Dumaguete City.
•	To provide an efficient and reliable platform for commuters, especially students, to request pedicab services.
•	To improve the organization and monitoring of pedicab operations through a TMO-managed web platform.
•	To promote safer driving practices by encouraging rest breaks and minimizing unnecessary routes.
•	To enhance daily income and operational efficiency of pedicab drivers by optimizing passenger pickups and routes.

The Pedicab Driver Decision Fatigue Support System is created, owned, and maintained by the researchers. They are responsible for building the system, updating it, managing data, and providing technical support.
 	The system is not only for academic purposes but is also meant to be used in real-life situations. It is designed so it can be improved and expanded in the future while still protecting ethical use and data privacy.
 	The system will be implemented in partnership with the Local Government Unit (LGU) of Dumaguete City, especially the Traffic Management Office (TMO). Instead of charging individual pedicab drivers, the system will be licensed to the LGU on a yearly basis.
Under this setup, the LGU or TMO pays the annual license fee, and all registered pedicab drivers can use the system for free.

 	it is a mobile-based system that can be used by both pedicab drivers and commuters, particularly students. Students can request a pedicab by tapping the mobile application.
Once a request is sent, the system automatically detects and notifies nearby pedicab drivers through their mobile application. This reduces the need for drivers to constantly search for passengers and make repeated decisions while on duty.
 	Through this system, pedicab drivers benefit in several ways. It helps reduce mental fatigue by simplifying daily decision-making, such as where to find passengers and when to take breaks. The system also promotes safer driving by encouraging rest periods and minimizing stress caused by long working hours. In addition, drivers can improve their daily income by efficiently locating passengers and avoiding unnecessary routes.
 	The system also includes a web-based platform for the Traffic Management Office (TMO), allowing authorized personnel to manage users, monitor system usage, and support organized and efficient pedicab operations within Dumaguete City.
